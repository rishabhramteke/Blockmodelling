# Blockmodelling
Discovering Latent Blockmodels with multiple information (Matlab Code)

Extended Blockmodelling to incorporate multiple sources of information including multiple edges and node features which improved on the state of the art for various real datasets. Devised new, efficient approaches to perform pareto based optimisation based on idea of homophily, that can find groups of nodes that are highly similar in connections and/or attributes. Conducted experiments to benchmark performance of various architectures against previous work

I have submitted the paper 'Simultaneous Encoding-Decoding for Discovering Blockmodels of Multi-view Social Networks' for AAAI conference 2020.The results will be announced by November 2019 and then if selected the paper will be officially published on AAAI website.
