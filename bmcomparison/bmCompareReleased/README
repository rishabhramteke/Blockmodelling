Implementation for comparison measures proposed in the following paper:

J. Chan, X. Nguyen, W. Liu, C. Leckie, J. Bailey, K. Ramamohanarao and J. Pei.
"Structure-aware Distance Measures for Comparing Clusterings in Graphs".
In Proceedings of the 18th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, May 2014.

Main files are bmUnweighteRecon.m and bmWeightedRecon.m.
bmUnweightedRecon.m contains the reconstruction distances for unweighted graphs.
bmWeightedRecon.m contains the reconstruction distances for weighted graphs.
